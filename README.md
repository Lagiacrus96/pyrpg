# Pygame RPG Project

Welcome to my Pygame RPG project! This repository contains a simple RPG (Role-Playing Game) developed using Pygame, a set of Python modules designed for writing video games.

## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate basic game development concepts using Pygame. The game features an exploration mode where the player can move around a map, encountering enemies randomly. Upon encountering an enemy, the game switches to a turn-based battle mode where the player can choose actions such as attacking, using abilities, using items, or fleeing.

## Features

- **Exploration Mode**: Navigate a grid-based map using arrow keys or WASD controls.
- **Turn-Based Battle System**: Engage in battles with enemies using a turn-based system.
- **Player and Enemy Entities**: Characters and enemies are represented as entities on the map.
- **Health Management**: Characters and enemies have health points that decrease as they take damage.
- **Battle UI**: Displays health bars and battle options during combat.

## Getting Started

To run the game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pygame-rpg.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: 
   ```bash
   cd pygame-rpg
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: 
   Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.

4. **Run the Game**: 
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. **Controls**:
   - Use arrow keys or WASD to move during exploration.
   - Press SPACE to toggle the inventory during exploration.
   - Use arrow keys to navigate and ENTER to select options during battles.

## Future Improvements

- Implement character leveling and progression.
- Add more enemies with varied abilities and behaviors.
- Include more items and abilities for the player to use during battles.
- Improve the game's graphical assets and user interface.
